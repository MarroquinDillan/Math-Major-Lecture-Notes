# Math-Major-Lecture-Notes
This repository is a collection of my lecture notes, study guides, homework answers, and other documents during my time as a math and stats undergraduate student at the University of Nevada Reno from 2019-2022. This collection was all typeset in LaTex software using Overleaf - a cloud based editor.

CLASSES COVERED:
- MATH 305: Functions and Modeling
- MATH 310: Real Analysis I
- MATH 311: Real Analysis II
- MATH 331: Groups, Rings, and Fields (Abstract Algebra)

All code is my own, however all content resides to that of UNR and the professors that taught the course.
